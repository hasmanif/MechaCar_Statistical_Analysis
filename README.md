## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

From our linear regression model, the r-swaured value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variability of our dependent variable (MPG) is explained using this linear model. The higher the correlation is between two variables, the more one variable can predict the value of the other.

As for the p-value of our linear regression analysis, 5.35 x10^-11 is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, therefore we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

In addition to the statistical test, we can determine which variables provide a significant contribution to the linear model by comparing the individual p-values represented by the numbers in the PR(>|t|) column. According to the results, Vehicle Length. Ground Clearance and Y-intercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Therefore, you can say that the vehicles length and groud clearance have a significant impact on the MPG.

It is fair to say that a linear regression model is appropriate for this dataset and does provide the information on which variables were statistcally unlikely to provide random amounts of variance. However, the amount of information that can be obtained and analyzed will be far greater using a multiple linear regression model.
